# Hermes Linear Agent

Standalone [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) platform plugin for Linear Agent Sessions. It lets a Hermes gateway profile appear in Linear as an app-attributed Linear Agent, receives signed Agent Session webhooks, sends responses as Agent Activities, and provides 58 `linear_agent_*` tools whose mutations are attributed to the app.

This is an independent third-party plugin: it does not patch or vendor the Hermes core repository.

## Install

From Git (recommended):

```bash
hermes plugins install infinityrobot/hermes-linear-agent --enable
```

Or, after a package release, install it into the same Python environment as Hermes:

```bash
python -m pip install hermes-linear-agent
hermes plugins enable linear-agent
```

Hermes itself is not distributed as a wheel and must not be added as a pip dependency. The Git installation path above is recommended for normal Hermes installations; the wheel path is intended for managed or development environments that already contain Hermes.

Then verify discovery and run the platform setup wizard:

```bash
hermes plugins list
hermes gateway setup
```

The plugin ID is `linear-agent`; the gateway platform and toolset key remain `linear_agent`.

## Recommended OAuth setup

For Linear Agent/app attribution, use Linear OAuth 2.0 client credentials. Hermes stores the Linear OAuth app client ID/secret in the active profile `.env`. This plugin mints an app-actor access token with `grant_type=client_credentials`, caches it in profile-scoped plugin storage at `plugin-state/linear-agent/oauth.json`, and gets a new token before expiry or after a Linear GraphQL 401. No browser flow or refresh token is required.

Fastest path: `hermes gateway setup` → **Linear Agent** — the wizard prompts for credentials, verifies them against Linear, auto-detects the app user ID, and builds the allowlist interactively. Manual steps below.

1. In Linear, create or open the OAuth application for the agent and enable/use client credentials for the app.

2. Add the OAuth app credentials to the profile `.env`:

   ```bash
   LINEAR_AGENT_CLIENT_ID=...
   LINEAR_AGENT_CLIENT_SECRET=...
   ```

   Every token is requested with the same fixed scopes: `read,write,app:assignable,app:mentionable,customer:read,customer:write,initiative:read,initiative:write`. They are not configurable, because Linear revokes all of an app's tokens and replaces its installed scopes whenever a token is requested with a different set. That would strip `app:assignable`/`app:mentionable` from the agent, or make two gateways on the same app revoke each other. A cached token with other scopes is discarded and minted again.

3. Optional one-time mint/test for a pip or source installation:

   ```bash
   hermes-linear-agent-oauth \
     --profile <profile> \
     --client-credentials
   ```

   The helper reads `LINEAR_AGENT_CLIENT_ID` and `LINEAR_AGENT_CLIENT_SECRET` from the profile `.env`, writes the cached access token/expiry to plugin-owned state, and does not print token values. Runtime token reissue works from the client ID/secret even if the cached token is absent. Git-only installations can use `hermes gateway setup` instead.

4. Restart the profile gateway:

   ```bash
   hermes gateway restart
   ```

At runtime, the adapter uses client credentials first, reads and persists the current access token/expiry in plugin-owned profile state by default, and retries once after a Linear GraphQL 401. Set `LINEAR_AGENT_PERSIST_TOKENS=false` to disable access token persistence. For migration, the plugin can read an older `providers.linear_agent` entry from Hermes' shared `auth.json`, but never writes to that file.

### Legacy browser OAuth setup

The older authorization-code + localhost callback flow is still available as a fallback when `LINEAR_AGENT_REFRESH_TOKEN` is configured. Run the same helper without `--client-credentials` to exchange a browser authorization code and cache rotating access/refresh tokens in plugin-owned state.

## Manual/static token setup

If you already have a valid Linear app/OAuth token, you can still set secrets manually in the profile `.env`:

```bash
LINEAR_AGENT_ACCESS_TOKEN=lin_oauth_or_app_token
LINEAR_AGENT_WEBHOOK_SECRET=linear_webhook_signing_secret
```

Optional:

```bash
LINEAR_AGENT_CLIENT_ID=
LINEAR_AGENT_CLIENT_SECRET=
LINEAR_AGENT_REFRESH_TOKEN=
LINEAR_AGENT_TOKEN_EXPIRES_AT=
LINEAR_AGENT_REDIRECT_URI=
LINEAR_AGENT_OAUTH_ACTOR=app
LINEAR_AGENT_APP_USER_ID=
LINEAR_AGENT_WORKSPACE_ID=
LINEAR_AGENT_HOME_TARGET=
LINEAR_AGENT_ALLOWED_USERS=
LINEAR_AGENT_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=
LINEAR_AGENT_AUTH_PATH=
```

Authorization is two-layer and **fail-closed at both layers**: the gateway grants access via `LINEAR_AGENT_ALLOWED_USERS` / `LINEAR_AGENT_ALLOW_ALL_USERS` (no allowlist means every user is denied), and the adapter checks the sender BEFORE any webhook side effect by consulting the gateway-registered authorization chain (the same one dispatch uses — env allowlists including the `*` wildcard, `GATEWAY_ALLOWED_USERS`, DM-pairing grants), with YAML `allowed_users` / `allow_all_users` granting as a union. With nothing configured anywhere, webhooks are rejected 403 and no ack/auto-start/stop activity ever fires. `allowed_teams` narrows further and never grants.

`LINEAR_AGENT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is effectively required: unsigned webhooks are **rejected** unless you explicitly opt out with `allow_unsigned_webhooks: true` (or `LINEAR_AGENT_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_WEBHOOKS=true`). When the secret is set, incoming webhook requests must include a valid Linear HMAC signature.

`LINEAR_AGENT_HOME_TARGET` enables cron delivery: set it to an issue ID or identifier (e.g. `ENG-123`) and `deliver=linear_agent` cron jobs post their results as comments on that issue — including when cron runs out-of-process from the gateway. Setting it also silences the gateway's one-time "no home channel" notice, which otherwise posts into each new session thread.

## Config

Keep OAuth client secrets and webhook secrets in `.env`; runtime OAuth access/refresh tokens belong in the plugin-owned state file. The state file is atomically written, process-locked, and mode `0600` on POSIX. Do not put secrets in `config.yaml` or docs.

## Local Run

```bash
hermes gateway start
```

Point Linear's Agent Session webhook at:

```text
https://your-public-host.example/hermes/linear-agent
```

For local development, expose the configured port with a tunnel and use the tunnel HTTPS URL.

## Notes

- Normal Hermes final responses are sent as Linear `response` activities. For comment-mention sessions Linear mirrors the response into the session's thread; mentioning the agent inside an existing thread makes Linear re-anchor the conversation at a new root comment, so the reply appears there rather than in the original thread.
- New sessions optionally receive a quick `thought` acknowledgement.
- Dispatch failures are reported as Linear `error` activities.
- All write tools (issues, comments, projects, status updates, milestones, initiatives, documents, customer needs, releases) are gated by `mutation_policy` and fail closed by default. Agent-session activities (responses/thoughts/errors) are the core protocol and are not gated.
- Set `LINEAR_AGENT_APP_USER_ID` (or `app_user_id`) so issue-update webhooks triggered by the agent's own mutations are ignored — without it, every write the agent makes echoes back as a new session. When unset, the adapter auto-discovers the id from Linear's `viewer` query at connect (best-effort backstop; setting it explicitly is still recommended).
- Issue-update webhooks feed auto-start only by default — delegation itself arrives as a real `created` agent session, so dispatching update webhooks as turns too would double-process every delegation. Opt in with `dispatch_issue_updates: true` to react to issue edits; those turns have no agent session, so replies post as issue comments (requires `mutation_policy.create_comments: true`).
- `reply_in_source_thread: true` is an opt-in **workaround** for a Linear limitation: a session response can't render inline in the thread the agent was mentioned from (only the first-party `@Linear` assistant can), so when on, the agent also replies on the mention's source comment. Content then appears in both the session widget and the thread. Default off matches other third-party agents. **Remove this flag** if Linear ships native inline/source-thread replies for third-party agents (see the adapter's `_reply_in_source_thread` comment for the unwind steps).
- `linear_agent_update_issue`/`create_issue` accept a workflow state NAME (`state: "Done"`) and resolve it to the required `stateId` automatically.
- MCP parity: `update_issue`/`create_issue` also resolve friendly reference keys (`assignee` by name/email/`me`, `labels`, `project`, `team`, `cycle`, `milestone`, `delegate`) to Linear's `*Id` fields; `null` clears where Linear allows it, and raw `*Id` keys still pass straight through. Ambiguous or unknown names abort BEFORE the mutation and name the lookup tool.
- `update_issue` manages issue relations (`blocks`, `blockedBy`, `relatedTo` — append-only; `removeBlocks`/`removeBlockedBy`/`removeRelatedTo` to remove; `parentId`; `duplicateOf`) and URL attachments (`links: [{url, title}]`, append-only). `blockedBy` is stored as the inverse of `blocks`.
- `linear_agent_create_comment` also edits an existing comment (pass `comment_id`, gated on `update_comments`) and posts threaded replies (`parentId`). Comments can target a non-issue parent — pass exactly ONE of `project_id`, `project_update_id`, `initiative_id`, `initiative_update_id`, or `document_content_id` instead of `issue_id`.
- Customers, release notes, and issue labels: `linear_agent_save_customer` (gated on `create_customers`/`update_customers`), `linear_agent_delete_customer` (`delete_customers`), `linear_agent_save_release_note` (release-family umbrella — `create_releases`/`update_releases`; `pipelineId` required to create), and `linear_agent_create_issue_label` (`create_labels`; omit `team_id` for a workspace-wide label). New reads (no policy): `linear_agent_get_team`, `_get_milestone`, `_get_document`, `_get_attachment`, `_get_release_note`, `_get_agent_skill`, `_list_project_labels`, `_list_release_notes`, `_list_agent_skills`.
- Delete tools (`linear_agent_delete_comment`, `_delete_customer_need`, `_delete_status_update`, `_delete_attachment`) require explicit IDs and are each gated by their own `delete_*` policy key (all default `false`). Status updates route through Linear's archive mutation.
- MCP migration: prefer `linear_agent_*` over `mcp_linear_*` — every MCP Linear tool available in Linear's public GraphQL API has an equivalent here, with app attribution and fail-closed write policies on top.

### Linear Agent Interaction Guidelines alignment

- The `created` acknowledgement runs concurrently with dispatch so the webhook responds within Linear's 5-second deadline and the session is acknowledged well inside the 10-second unresponsive-marking window.
- Clarifying questions post as `elicitation` activities, so the session shows `awaitingInput` in Linear's UI; the user's reply arrives as a normal `prompted` follow-up.
- Long turns surface an ephemeral "Working on it…" `thought` (rate-limited) as Linear's equivalent of a typing indicator.
- `linear_agent_set_session_links` attaches external URLs (PRs, docs) to the session — these render in Linear and also count as session activity.
- `linear_agent_update_plan` publishes the agent's execution plan (Linear **Agent Plans**, technology preview) as a live checklist on the session. The plan is replaced in full on every call — the model sends every step with its current status (`pending`/`inProgress`/`completed`/`canceled`).
- **Disengagement respect (`stop` signal):** a human `stop` signal (delivered on a `prompted` Agent Activity) halts the session immediately — the activity body is not dispatched as a prompt, any in-flight turn is interrupted, and a single confirming `response` activity is posted. No further Linear writes are made for that turn.
- The GraphQL client retries once on HTTP 429 honoring `Retry-After`, and routes through `LINEAR_AGENT_PROXY`/standard proxy env vars when set.
- Do not put real tokens or webhook secrets in `config.yaml` or docs.

### Linear agent best-practices alignment

- **Auto-start on delegation (default on, opt-out):** when an issue is delegated to the agent (an assignment/update webhook, or the issue's `delegate` is this app user), the adapter moves it to the team's first `started` workflow state (lowest `position`) — Linear's published best practice. Opt out with `auto_start_on_delegation: false`; also gated on `mutation_policy.update_issues`. Issues in a `triage` state are left alone so humans keep control of triage, and a bare @-mention is not treated as delegation.
- **Self-delegation (opt-in, default off):** with `auto_self_delegate: true` (or `LINEAR_AGENT_AUTO_SELF_DELEGATE`), auto-started issues that have NO delegate are also claimed by the agent. By default the adapter **never delegates issues to itself** — humans decide what the agent owns.
- **Permission-change awareness:** OAuth `revoked` and `teamAccessChanged` webhook events are logged loudly at WARNING (instead of being silently ignored) so a revoked token or lost team access is diagnosable.
